# Team Portfolio Website - Fixed Issues

The following issues have been fixed in this website:

1. Added background images for team member profiles
2. Fixed email validation regex in the contact form
3. Fixed mobile menu navigation
4. Added back-to-top button to all pages
5. Fixed form validation for the contact form
6. Added placeholder images for team members
7. Added missing animation in testimonial slider

All pages now have a consistent back-to-top button that appears when scrolling down, making navigation easier on longer pages.

To add real team member images, replace the placeholder files in the `/images` directory:
- team-lead.jpg
- member-1.jpg
- member-2.jpg
- member-3.jpg
- member-4.jpg Website
